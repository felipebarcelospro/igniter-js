# @igniter-js/adapter-mcp-server

## 0.3.0 (Unreleased)

### Major Changes

- **API Refactoring for Improved Type Safety and Developer Experience**

  The API has been refactored to provide better type inference and a cleaner developer experience.

  #### Breaking Changes

  1. **New Function Signature**: Changed from `createMcpAdapter(router, options)` to `createMcpAdapter(options)` where `router` is now a required property in the options object.

  2. **Automatic Context Inference**: The `context` function option has been removed. Context is now automatically inferred from the router's built-in context, eliminating the need for manual context creation.

  **Migration:**

  ```typescript
  // Before (v0.2.x)
  const handler = createMcpAdapter(AppRouter, {
    serverInfo: { name: 'My Server', version: '1.0.0' },
    context: (req) => ({
      context: { user: 'test' },
      tools: [],
      request: req,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    })
  });

  // After (v0.3.x)
  const handler = createMcpAdapter({
    router: AppRouter,
    serverInfo: { name: 'My Server', version: '1.0.0' },
    // context is automatically inferred!
  });
  ```

#### New Features

  - **Custom Prompts**: Register prompts that AI agents can use to guide interactions
    ```typescript
    prompts: {
      custom: [{
        name: 'debugUser',
        description: 'Debug user account issues',
        handler: async (args, context) => ({ /* ... */ })
      }]
    }
    ```

  - **Custom Resources**: Expose resources that AI agents can read
    ```typescript
    resources: {
      custom: [{
        uri: 'config://app/settings',
        name: 'Application Settings',
        handler: async (context) => ({ /* ... */ })
      }]
    }
    ```

  - **OAuth Authorization**: First-class support for OAuth-based authorization
    ```typescript
    oauth: {
      issuer: 'https://auth.example.com',
      resourceMetadataPath: '/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource',
      scopes: ['mcp:read', 'mcp:write'],
      verifyToken: async (token, context) => ({ valid: true })
    }
    ```
    - Automatic Bearer token verification
    - Protected resource metadata endpoint exposure
    - Proper 401 responses with WWW-Authenticate headers

  #### Improvements

  - **Enhanced Type Inference**: All handlers (prompts, resources, oauth.verifyToken, events) now automatically receive the correctly typed context from the router
  - **Reduced Boilerplate**: No need to manually create and return context objects
  - **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive examples showing all new features
  - **Cleaner API**: Single configuration object is more intuitive and easier to understand
