Modern API development shouldn't require juggling multiple applications. Yet developers constantly switch between their code editor, terminal, and separate API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia. This context-switching destroys focus and slows development.

**Igniter Studio** eliminates this friction by providing a beautiful, interactive API playground built directly into your Igniter.js application. But this is just the beginning—we're building toward a complete AI-powered command center for modern development.

## The Context-Switching Problem

A typical development workflow looks like this:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Write Code
    Make changes in your code editor
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start Server
    Switch to terminal, run development server
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Test API
    Switch to Postman/Insomnia, manually configure request
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Check Logs
    Switch back to terminal to view logs
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Debug Issue
    Switch back to code editor
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each context switch breaks your flow and consumes mental energy. **What if all of this happened in one place?**

## Introducing Igniter Studio

Igniter Studio is an interactive API playground that lives alongside your application, automatically consuming your OpenAPI specification to provide a rich, type-aware testing interface.

Built on [Scalar API Reference](https://github.com/scalar/scalar), it offers a modern, beautiful UI that makes API exploration intuitive and enjoyable.

### Get Started in Seconds

Launch Igniter Studio by adding a single flag to your development command:

```bash
npx @igniter-js/cli dev --docs
```

That's it! Navigate to `/docs` on your local server and you'll see your entire API ready to explore.

<Callout type="success" title="Zero Configuration Required">
Igniter Studio automatically detects your API structure from the generated OpenAPI specification. No manual setup, no configuration files—it just works.
</Callout>

## See It in Action

Watch how seamlessly Igniter Studio integrates into your development workflow:

## Current Features

### Interactive API Explorer

Browse your entire API structure with an intuitive, searchable interface. Each endpoint displays:

- **Complete type information** derived from your Zod schemas
- **Request/response examples** automatically generated from your types
- **Authentication requirements** clearly documented
- **Parameter descriptions** from your JSDoc comments

### Live API Testing

Test endpoints directly in the browser with:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Smart Request Builder
    Auto-complete for parameters, headers, and request bodies based on your API types
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Real-Time Responses
    See responses instantly with syntax highlighting and formatting
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Request History
    Access previous requests to quickly iterate on testing
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Code Generation
    Export working code samples in multiple languages (cURL, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Automatic Documentation

Your API documentation stays in sync with your code because it's generated from the same source of truth:

```typescript
// Your controller automatically generates documentation
export const userController = igniter.controller({
  path: '/users',
  actions: {
    getUser: igniter.query({
      path: '/:id',
      description: 'Retrieve a user by ID', // Shows in Studio
      query: z.object({
        id: z.string().uuid().describe('The user UUID')
      }),
      handler: async ({ request, response, context }) => {
        // Implementation
      }
    })
  }
})
```

This description and parameter documentation automatically appears in Igniter Studio—no separate documentation files to maintain.

## The Vision: Your AI-Powered Command Center

Igniter Studio today is powerful, but it's just the foundation. We're building toward a complete development command center that brings together everything you need to build, test, and monitor your application.

## The Game-Changer: Integrated AI Assistant

The most transformative feature on our roadmap is **Lia**, your AI assistant, integrated directly into Igniter Studio.

### Natural Language Development

Imagine debugging and managing your application using conversational language:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Ask Questions
    **You:** "Lia, what was the payload of the last failed request to `/users`?"
    
    **Lia:** "The last failed request at 14:32:15 had an invalid email format in the request body..."
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Execute Commands
    **You:** "Lia, run the test suite for the auth feature."
    
    **Lia:** "Running tests... 12 passed, 1 failed. The `login` test is failing due to..."
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create Dashboards
    **You:** "Lia, create a dashboard tracking API error rates over 24 hours."
    
    **Lia:** "Dashboard created. I've added widgets for total errors, error rate trend, and top failing endpoints..."
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Get Guidance
    **You:** "Lia, how do I add a new scope to authentication?"
    
    **Lia:** "To add a new authentication scope, you'll need to modify your auth procedure. Here's how..."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Context-Aware Assistance

Unlike generic AI chatbots, Lia has **full context** of your application:

- Real-time access to your code structure
- Live monitoring data from your running application
- Complete request/response history
- Historical performance metrics
- Your specific architectural patterns

This creates an unprecedented development experience where your AI assistant truly understands your application's state and can provide precise, actionable guidance.

## Technical Architecture

Igniter Studio is designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive:

### Development Mode

In development, Studio runs alongside your application:

```typescript
// Automatically enabled with --docs flag
npx @igniter-js/cli dev --docs

// Accessible at http://localhost:3000/docs
```

### Production Deployment

For production, you have options:

<Tabs items={['Disable', 'Protected', 'Separate']} groupId="production-mode">
  <Tab value="Disable">
    Completely disable Studio in production:
    ```typescript
    // igniter.config.ts
    export default {
      studio: {
        enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Protected">
    Enable Studio with authentication:
    ```typescript
    // igniter.config.ts
    export default {
      studio: {
        enabled: true,
        auth: {
          type: 'basic',
          users: [{ 
            username: process.env.STUDIO_USER,
            password: process.env.STUDIO_PASS 
          }]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Separate">
    Deploy Studio as a separate instance:
