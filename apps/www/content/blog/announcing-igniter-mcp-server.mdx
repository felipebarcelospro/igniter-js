As AI-native development tools reshape how we build software, understanding project context and maintaining architectural consistency has become the new bottleneck. With **Igniter.js MCP Server**, your AI coding assistants can now deeply understand your project structure, execute development commands, and provide intelligent assistance that goes far beyond basic code completion.

## The Evolution of AI-Assisted Development

The rise of AI-native IDEs like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code has enabled developers to write code at unprecedented speeds. But with this velocity comes a new challenge: **AI tools need context to be truly effective**.

Without proper context, even the most advanced AI assistants struggle to:
- Understand your project's architectural patterns
- Follow your specific coding conventions
- Execute project-specific commands correctly
- Maintain consistency across feature implementations

This is where the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** becomes transformative.

## What is MCP and Why Does It Matter?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard that enables Large Language Models to interact with external systems in a structured, type-safe manner. Think of it as a universal API that AI tools can use to:

- Access your project's file structure and codebase
- Execute development tasks and build commands
- Query project-specific information
- Leverage specialized tools designed for your framework

For Igniter.js, this means your AI assistant becomes a framework expert that understands not just TypeScript, but the specific patterns, conventions, and architecture of your Igniter.js application.

## Getting Started: Install in Under 2 Minutes

Every Igniter.js starter template (v1.0.0+) comes with MCP Server support out of the box. Integration is as simple as adding a configuration file to your AI tool.

<Callout type="success" title="Universal Compatibility">

## What Can the MCP Server Do?

The Igniter.js MCP Server exposes a comprehensive set of tools that transform your AI assistant into a specialized Igniter.js developer:

### Development Workflow Tools

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Start Development Servers
    Launch your application with live reloading and automatic client generation.
    ```typescript
    // AI can execute: start the dev server
    // Runs: igniter dev --watch
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Build for Production
    Compile and optimize your application for deployment.
    ```typescript
    // AI can execute: build the project
    // Runs: igniter build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run Test Suites
    Execute comprehensive tests with filtering and watch options.
    ```typescript
    // AI can execute: run tests for the auth feature
    // Runs: npm test -- --filter auth
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Code Analysis and Generation

- **Analyze Code Structure**: Identify architectural patterns and potential issues
- **Generate Type-Safe Clients**: Auto-generate fully typed API clients from your router
- **Create OpenAPI Documentation**: Generate interactive API documentation with Scalar UI
- **Scaffold Features**: Create complete feature modules from your Prisma schema

### AI-Powered Task Management

The MCP Server integrates with specialized AI agents (Claude, Gemini, GPT, Perplexity) to handle complex development tasks:

```typescript
// Ask your AI: "Create a new authentication feature with JWT tokens"
// The AI delegates to specialized agents who:
// 1. Analyze your current architecture
// 2. Generate the auth controller and procedures
// 3. Create database migrations
// 4. Write comprehensive tests
// 5. Update documentation
```

## Meet Lia: Your AI Framework Specialist

When you use an Igniter.js starter template, you're not just getting a codebase—you're getting **Lia**, a specialized AI agent trained specifically for Igniter.js development.

### How Lia Transforms Your AI Assistant

<Callout type="info" title="Before and After">
**Before MCP Integration:**
Your AI: "I see you have a Next.js project. Let me try to understand the structure..."

**After MCP Integration:**
Lia-Enhanced AI: "I can see this is an Igniter.js project with feature-based architecture. Your auth module is in `src/features/auth/`. I'll use the `generateController` tool to add the new endpoint following your established patterns."
</Callout>

### Lia's Capabilities

**Contextual Understanding**: Every action starts with comprehensive analysis of your project structure, conventions, and existing patterns.

**Tool Prioritization**: Instead of generic approaches, Lia automatically uses specialized Igniter.js tools for maximum accuracy and efficiency.

**Pattern Replication**: Learns from your existing code to maintain consistency across your entire application.

**Persistent Memory**: Stores architectural decisions and patterns, making future development faster and more consistent.

## Real-World Development Workflow

Here's a typical conversation with a Lia-enhanced AI assistant:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### You Ask for a Feature
    **You:** "Add user profile management to the auth feature"
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Lia Analyzes Context
    **AI:** "I'll analyze the current auth feature structure..."
    
    *Automatically runs analysis on the auth directory*
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Intelligent Implementation
    **AI:** "I can see you have a `user` controller with basic CRUD. I'll scaffold a `profile` controller following your patterns with Zod validation and the `ensure` plugin."
    
    *Uses `generateController` tool*
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Testing and Validation
    **AI:** "Now I'll test the implementation to ensure it integrates correctly..."
    
    *Runs validation using MCP Server tools*
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Knowledge Persistence
    **AI:** "Implementation complete! I've stored these patterns for future reference."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why This Matters for Your Workflow

### Before Igniter.js MCP Server

❌ AI guesses at project structure  
❌ Manual context switching between tools  
❌ Inconsistent code patterns  
❌ Repeated explanations of architecture  
❌ Generic solutions that don't fit your app

### After Igniter.js MCP Server

✅ AI deeply understands your project  
✅ Seamless tool integration  
✅ Consistent, pattern-aware code  
✅ Persistent architectural knowledge  
✅ Framework-specific, optimized solutions

## Advanced: Custom Rules for Maximum Productivity

Every Igniter.js starter includes custom rules that transform your AI assistant's behavior. These rules create a specialized development environment where:

- **File operations start with analysis** to understand context before making changes
- **Specialized tools are prioritized** over generic approaches
- **Architectural patterns are maintained** automatically across features
- **Development workflows are optimized** for Igniter.js best practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Continuous Learning">
The more you work with Lia-enhanced AI, the smarter it becomes. Every decision, pattern, and insight is stored, creating a continuously improving development assistant that understands your specific project better than any generic AI could.
