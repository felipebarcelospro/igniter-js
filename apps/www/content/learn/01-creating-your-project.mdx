## The Igniter.js CLI

The **Igniter.js CLI** is your best friend for building applications with Igniter.js. It's a powerful command-line tool that:

- 🏗️ **Scaffolds new projects** with interactive setup
- 🔄 **Generates features** automatically from Prisma schemas
- 📝 **Creates controllers and procedures** with proper structure
- 🔍 **Generates TypeScript client** and OpenAPI docs automatically
- 🚀 **Runs development server** with hot-reload and interactive dashboard

Think of it as your personal assistant that handles all the boilerplate so you can focus on building features.

## Creating Your Project

Let's create your link shortening SaaS! Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx @igniter-js/cli init shortify
```

This command launches an **interactive setup wizard** that will guide you through configuring your project.

<Callout type="info" title="Using a different package manager?">
The CLI works with any package manager:
- **npm**: `npx @igniter-js/cli init shortify`
- **pnpm**: `pnpx @igniter-js/cli init shortify`
- **yarn**: `yarn dlx @igniter-js/cli init shortify`
- **bun**: `bunx @igniter-js/cli init shortify`
</Callout>

## Interactive Setup Wizard

The CLI will ask you a series of questions to customize your project. Here's what to choose for our SaaS:

### 1. **Select a Framework**

```
? Which framework would you like to use?
  ❯ Next.js (Recommended for full-stack apps)
    Vite (For frontend + separate API)
    Remix
    Express
    Tanstack Start
```

**Choose: Next.js** - It's perfect for full-stack applications and gives us Server Components, API Routes, and excellent TypeScript support.

### 2. **Choose Your Database**

```
? Which database would you like to use?
  ❯ PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)
    MySQL
    SQLite (For development only)
    None (I'll set it up later)
```

**Choose: PostgreSQL** - It's robust, scalable, and has excellent Prisma support. We'll use a free hosted instance later.

### 3. **Select Your ORM**

```
? Which ORM would you like to use?
  ❯ Prisma (Recommended - Type-safe, great DX)
    Drizzle
    None
```

**Choose: Prisma** - Best developer experience, auto-generated types, and amazing tooling.

### 4. **Choose Features**

```
? Select the features you want to enable (use space to select):
  ◯ Store (Redis caching)
  ◯ Jobs (Background task processing with BullMQ)
  ◯ Logging (Structured logging)
  ◯ Telemetry (OpenTelemetry for monitoring)
```

**For now, let's start simple and select:**
- ✅ **Logging** - Essential for debugging
- ✅ **Telemetry** - Good to have from the start

We'll add Store and Jobs later when we implement analytics and background processing.

### 5. **Package Manager**

```
? Which package manager would you like to use?
  ❯ npm
    pnpm
    yarn
    bun
```

**Choose your preferred package manager** - I recommend **pnpm** or **bun** for faster installs, but **npm** works perfectly fine too.

### 6. **Additional Options**

```
? Would you like to initialize a Git repository? (Y/n)
? Would you like to set up Docker Compose? (Y/n)
? Would you like to install dependencies now? (Y/n)
```

- **Git**: ✅ Yes (essential for version control)
- **Docker Compose**: ❌ No (we'll use cloud services)
- **Install dependencies**: ✅ Yes (saves time)

## What Just Happened?

After you complete the wizard, the CLI will:

1. ✨ **Create your project directory** (`shortify/`)
2. 📦 **Generate all necessary files** (configuration, boilerplate, etc.)
3. 🔧 **Configure your selected features**
4. 📥 **Install all dependencies**
5. 🎯 **Initialize a Git repository**
6. 🎉 **Display next steps**

You'll see output like this:

```bash
✔ Project created successfully!
✔ Dependencies installed
✔ Git repository initialized

🎉 Your Igniter.js project is ready!

📁 Project: shortify
🚀 Framework: Next.js
💾 Database: PostgreSQL (Prisma)
✨ Features: Logging, Telemetry

Next steps:
  1. cd shortify
  2. Copy .env.example to .env and configure your environment
  3. Run 'npm run dev' to start the development server

Happy building! 🔥
```

## Exploring Your Project

Let's navigate into your new project and explore what was generated:

```bash
cd shortify
```

Here's the structure you'll see:

<Files>
  <Folder name="shortify" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="app">
        <File name="layout.tsx" />
        <File name="page.tsx" />
        <Folder name="api">
          <Folder name="[[...igniter]]">
            <File name="route.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="features">
        <Folder name="example">
          <Folder name="controllers">
            <File name="example.controller.ts" />
          </Folder>
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="services">
        <File name="logger.ts" />
        <File name="telemetry.ts" />
      </Folder>
      <File name="igniter.ts" />
      <File name="igniter.context.ts" />
      <File name="igniter.router.ts" />
      <File name="igniter.client.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="prisma">
      <File name="schema.prisma" />
    </Folder>
    <File name=".env.example" />
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="next.config.ts" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Key Files Explained

Let's understand what each important file does:

**`src/igniter.ts`**
The main Igniter.js instance. This is where you configure all your features, adapters, and plugins.

```typescript
// This file was generated with your selected features
export const igniter = Igniter
  .context(createIgniterAppContext())
  .logger(logger)           // ← You selected Logging
  .telemetry(telemetry)     // ← You selected Telemetry
  .config({
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    basePATH: '/api/v1',
  })
  .create()
```

**`src/igniter.router.ts`**
Your API router. All controllers are registered here.

```typescript
export const AppRouter = igniter.router({
  controllers: {
    example: exampleController, // ← Example controller
    // Your new controllers will be added here
  },
})
```

**`src/app/api/[[...igniter]]/route.ts`**
The Next.js API route that connects Igniter.js to Next.js. This is the magic glue!

**`prisma/schema.prisma`**
Your database schema. We'll design our tables here in the next chapter.

<Quiz
  question="What does the Igniter.js CLI do when you run 'init'?"
  options={[
    { label: "Only creates a package.json file", value: "package" },
    { label: "Downloads a pre-built template without customization", value: "template" },

  ]}
  explanation="The CLI runs an interactive setup wizard that asks you about your framework, database, features, and preferences, then generates a fully customized project structure based on your answers."
/>

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running your project, you need to configure environment variables. The CLI created an `.env.example` file with all the variables you need.

Copy it to create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open `.env` in your code editor. You'll see something like:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/shortify?schema=public"

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Igniter.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNITER_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNITER_API_BASE_PATH="/api/v1"
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Don't worry about the database yet!">
We'll set up a free PostgreSQL database in the next chapter. For now, you can leave the `DATABASE_URL` as is - we won't be using the database yet.
</Callout>

## Running Your Development Server

Now for the exciting part - let's start your application! Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command does three things:
1. 🔄 Starts the Next.js development server
2. 🔥 Starts Igniter.js with hot-reload
3. 🎯 Opens Igniter Studio (interactive API dashboard)

You'll see output like:

```bash
▲ Next.js 15.0.0
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Network:      http://192.168.1.100:3000

🔥 Igniter.js
  ✓ Router loaded successfully
  ✓ 1 controller registered (example)
  ✓ 1 endpoint available
  ✓ Client schema generated
  ✓ OpenAPI docs generated

📚 Igniter Studio: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/studio
📖 OpenAPI Docs: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs

Ready in 1.2s
```

## Testing Your API

Open your browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:3000** - Your Next.js homepage
**http://localhost:3000/api/v1/studio** - Igniter Studio (API dashboard)

### Using Igniter Studio

Igniter Studio is an **interactive API playground** that lets you:
- 📋 See all your endpoints
- 🧪 Test API calls directly in the browser
- 📝 View request/response schemas
- 🔍 Inspect the generated TypeScript types

Try calling the example endpoint:
1. Click on **"example"** in the sidebar
2. Click on **"GET /hello"**
3. Click **"Execute"**

You should see a response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello from example!"
}
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** Your Igniter.js application is running!

  ]}
  explanation="Igniter Studio is an interactive API playground that comes with every Igniter.js project. It lets you explore and test your API endpoints directly in your browser, eliminating the need for tools like Postman or cURL during development."

## Understanding the CLI Commands

Now that your project is running, let's learn about the other powerful CLI commands you'll use throughout development:

### `igniter dev`

```bash
npx igniter dev
```

Starts the development server with:
- 🔥 **Hot-reload** for Igniter.js changes
- 🚀 **Framework server** (Next.js in our case)
- 🎯 **Interactive dashboard** with live API explorer
- 📖 **Auto-generated OpenAPI docs**

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
The `dev` command is smart! It automatically detects your framework (Next.js) and runs the appropriate commands. You can also customize it with flags:

```bash
npx igniter dev --port 4000        # Custom port
npx igniter dev --no-interactive   # Disable interactive mode
```
</Callout>

### `igniter generate schema`

```bash
npx igniter generate schema
```

Generates the **TypeScript client** from your Igniter.js router. This runs automatically during `dev`, but you can also run it manually for:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Pre-commit hooks
- Manual type generation

### `igniter generate docs`

```bash
npx igniter generate docs
```

Generates **OpenAPI specification** and optionally a **Scalar UI** for your API documentation.

```bash
npx igniter generate docs --ui   # Generate interactive HTML docs
```

### `igniter generate feature`

```bash
npx igniter generate feature users --schema prisma:User
```

This is where the magic happens! This command:
1. Reads your Prisma schema
2. Generates a complete CRUD controller
3. Creates type-safe queries and mutations
4. Sets up proper file structure

We'll use this extensively in Chapter 4!

## Project Structure Deep Dive

Let's understand how your project is organized:

### Frontend Layer (`src/app/`)

```
src/app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout, providers
├── page.tsx            # Homepage
└── api/
    └── [[...igniter]]/ # Igniter.js catch-all route
        └── route.ts
```

This is your **Next.js App Router** structure. The `[[...igniter]]` route is special - it catches all API requests and forwards them to Igniter.js.

### Backend Layer (`src/features/`)

```
src/features/
└── example/
    └── controllers/
        └── example.controller.ts
```

This is your **Igniter.js API**. Each feature is self-contained with its controllers, procedures, and business logic. This **feature-based architecture** keeps your code organized as your app grows.

### Configuration (`src/igniter.*.ts`)

```
src/
├── igniter.ts          # Main Igniter instance
├── igniter.context.ts  # Application context & DI
├── igniter.router.ts   # API router
└── igniter.client.ts   # Auto-generated client
```

These files work together to create your API:
- **`igniter.ts`**: Configures features and adapters
- **`igniter.context.ts`**: Defines what's available globally (DB, logger, etc.)
- **`igniter.router.ts`**: Registers all your controllers
- **`igniter.client.ts`**: Auto-generated type-safe client for the frontend

### Services (`src/services/`)

```
src/services/
├── logger.ts       # Structured logging
└── telemetry.ts    # OpenTelemetry setup
```

These are your **infrastructure services** - things like logging, caching, job processing, etc.

## Next Steps
