## Redis Setup

Setting up Redis is the first step in using the Store adapter. Redis can run locally for development or use a managed service for production. Understanding your setup options helps you choose the right approach for your environment and ensures your Redis connection is configured correctly.

The Redis setup process varies depending on your development environment and production requirements. For local development, running Redis in Docker is often the fastest way to get started, while production environments benefit from managed services that handle scaling, backups, and high availability.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Local Development">
    For local development, you can run Redis using Docker, which is the quickest way to get started. Docker ensures Redis runs in an isolated environment and makes it easy to match production configurations. Alternatively, you can install Redis directly on your system if you prefer a native installation.
    
    **Using Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
    ```
    
    **macOS:**
    ```bash
    brew install redis
    brew services start redis
    ```
    
    **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install redis-server
    sudo systemctl start redis
    ```
    
    **Windows:**
    Download and install from [Redis Windows](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases) or use WSL.
    
    Docker is recommended for local development as it's consistent across platforms and makes it easy to reset or upgrade Redis versions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Production">
    For production, use a managed Redis service that handles scaling, backups, and high availability. Managed services eliminate the operational overhead of running Redis yourself and provide built-in features like automatic failover, monitoring, and scaling.
    
    Popular managed Redis services include:
    - **Redis Cloud** (https://redis.com/cloud)
    - **AWS ElastiCache**
    - **Google Cloud Memorystore**
    - **Azure Cache for Redis**
    
    Managed services provide production-grade reliability and eliminate the need to manage Redis infrastructure yourself. They handle backups, scaling, and high availability automatically.

## Configuration

Configuring the Store adapter involves creating a Redis client, setting up environment variables, and registering the adapter with Igniter. This process ensures your application can connect to Redis and use the Store adapter's features. Proper configuration is essential for both development and production environments.

Understanding configuration options helps you optimize your Redis connection for your specific use case, whether you need connection pooling, retry strategies, or TLS encryption for production deployments.

### 1. Create the Redis Client

Create a dedicated service file for your Redis connection:

```typescript
// src/services/store.ts
import { createRedisStoreAdapter } from '@igniter-js/adapter-redis';
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

// Create Redis client
const redis = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT || '6379'),
  password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
  db: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_DB || '0'),
  
  // Connection options
  retryStrategy: (times) => {
    const delay = Math.min(times * 50, 2000);
    return delay;
  },
  
  maxRetriesPerRequest: 3,
  
  // Enable offline queue for better resilience
  enableOfflineQueue: true,
});

// Handle connection events
redis.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('✅ Redis connected');
});

redis.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('❌ Redis connection error:', err);
});

redis.on('close', () => {
  console.log('⚠️ Redis connection closed');
});

// Create the adapter
export const store = createRedisStoreAdapter(redis);
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your Redis configuration:

```bash
# .env
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-password-here
REDIS_DB=0

# Or use a Redis URL
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

**Using Redis URL:**

```typescript
// src/services/store.ts
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
export const store = createRedisStoreAdapter(redis);
```

### 3. Register with Igniter

Register the store adapter in your main Igniter configuration:

```typescript
// src/igniter.ts
import { Igniter } from '@igniter-js/core';
import { store } from './services/store';

export const igniter = Igniter
  .context<AppContext>()
  .store(store)
  .create();
```

## Configuration Options

The `ioredis` client supports extensive configuration options that allow you to customize connection behavior, retry strategies, and connection pooling. Understanding these options helps you optimize your Redis connection for production environments where reliability and performance are critical.

Proper configuration ensures your Redis connection is resilient, performs well under load, and handles network issues gracefully. Each option serves a specific purpose in building a production-ready Redis setup.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Connection Configuration">
    The `ioredis` client supports many configuration options for fine-tuning your Redis connection. These options control connection behavior, retry strategies, and connection pooling.
    
    ```typescript
    const redis = new Redis({
      // Basic connection
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 6379,
      password: 'your-password',
      db: 0,
      
      // Connection pool
      connectTimeout: 10000,
      lazyConnect: false,
      
      // Retry strategy
      retryStrategy: (times) => {
        if (times > 3) {
          return null; // Stop retrying
        }
        return Math.min(times * 50, 2000);
      },
      
      maxRetriesPerRequest: 3,
      
      // Keep alive
      keepAlive: 30000,
      
      // TLS/SSL (for production)
      tls: {
        // TLS options if using secure connection
      },
    });
    ```
    
    Connection configuration options help you manage connection lifecycle, handle network issues, and optimize for your specific use case. Retry strategies are especially important for production environments where network interruptions can occur.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection Pooling">
    For production applications, consider connection pooling to improve performance and handle high request volumes. Connection pooling manages multiple Redis connections efficiently, reducing connection overhead and improving throughput.
    
    ```typescript
    import { Redis, Cluster } from 'ioredis';
    
    // Standard single instance
    const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
    
    // Redis Cluster (for high availability)
    const cluster = new Cluster([
      { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 7000 },
      { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 7001 },
      { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 7002 },
    ], {
      redisOptions: {
        password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
      },
    });
    
    export const store = createRedisStoreAdapter(cluster);
    ```
    
    Connection pooling and Redis Cluster are essential for high-traffic applications. They improve performance, enable horizontal scaling, and provide high availability.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Sharing Redis Connection

You can share the same Redis client between the Store adapter and other adapters (like BullMQ for jobs):

```typescript
// src/services/store.ts
import { createRedisStoreAdapter } from '@igniter-js/adapter-redis';
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

// Create a single Redis client
export const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

// Create store adapter
export const store = createRedisStoreAdapter(redis);
```

```typescript
// src/services/jobs.ts
import { createBullMQAdapter } from '@igniter-js/adapter-bullmq';
import { store, redis } from './store';

// Share the Redis connection
export const jobs = createBullMQAdapter({
  store, // Uses the same Redis connection
});
```

<Callout type="success" title="Best Practice">
  Sharing a single Redis client between adapters is more efficient than creating multiple connections. The adapter handles separate clients internally for Pub/Sub operations.
</Callout>

---

## Health Checks

Add health check endpoints to monitor Redis connectivity:

```typescript
export const healthController = igniter.controller({
  path: '/health',
  actions: {
    check: igniter.query({
      handler: async ({ context, response }) => {
        try {
          // Test Redis connection
          await igniter.store.has('health:check');
          
          return response.success({
            status: 'healthy',
            store: 'connected',
          });
        } catch (error) {
          return response.error({
            status: 'unhealthy',
            store: 'disconnected',
            error: error.message,
          });
        }
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

## Troubleshooting

When setting up Redis, you may encounter connection issues, authentication problems, or memory constraints. Understanding common issues and their solutions helps you troubleshoot problems quickly and get your Redis connection working correctly.

These troubleshooting tips cover the most common issues developers face when setting up Redis for the first time or when deploying to production.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Connection Refused">
    If you see `ECONNREFUSED` errors, Redis isn't running or isn't accessible at the configured host and port. This is the most common issue when setting up Redis for the first time.
    
    **1. Verify Redis is running:**
    ```bash
    redis-cli ping
    # Should return: PONG
    ```
    
    **2. Check host and port:**
    ```typescript
    const redis = new Redis({
      host: 'localhost', // Not '127.0.0.1' if using Docker
      port: 6379,
    });
    ```
    
    **3. Check firewall settings:**
    Ensure port 6379 is open
    
    Connection refused errors usually mean Redis isn't running or isn't accessible. Check that Redis is running and that your connection configuration matches your Redis setup.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failed">
    If authentication fails, your password doesn't match Redis's configured password. This is common when using managed Redis services or when Redis has been configured with a password.
    
    **1. Verify password:**
    ```bash
    redis-cli -a your-password ping
    ```
    
    **2. Check Redis configuration:**
    Look for `requirepass` in `redis.conf`
    
    Authentication failures mean your password is incorrect or Redis isn't configured to require authentication. Verify your password matches Redis's configuration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Memory Issues">
    If Redis runs out of memory, it may reject write operations or evict keys. This is common when caching large amounts of data or when Redis hasn't been configured with appropriate memory limits.
    
    **1. Set max memory:**
    ```bash
    redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory 256mb
    ```
    
    **2. Configure eviction policy:**
    ```bash
    redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
    ```
    
    Memory issues can cause performance problems or data loss. Configure appropriate memory limits and eviction policies based on your use case.
