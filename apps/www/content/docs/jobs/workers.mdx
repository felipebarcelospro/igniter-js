title: Workers
description: Configure and manage workers to process jobs from your queues with concurrency control, event handlers, and lifecycle management.
---

Workers are the processes that execute your background jobs. They continuously poll Redis for new jobs and execute them according to your configuration. Understanding how to configure and manage workers is essential for building reliable job processing systems.

## Automatic Worker Startup

The easiest way to start workers is through `autoStartWorker` configuration:

```typescript
import { createBullMQAdapter } from '@igniter-js/adapter-bullmq';

const jobs = createBullMQAdapter({
  store: redisStore,
  autoStartWorker: {
    concurrency: 5, // Process up to 5 jobs concurrently
    queues: ['default'], // Process jobs from these queues
    debug: true, // Enable debug logging
  },
});
```

When jobs are registered via `jobs.merge()`, workers automatically start for the discovered queues.

<Callout type="info" title="Auto-Start Behavior">
  With `autoStartWorker` enabled, workers start automatically when you register jobs. This is convenient for development but you may want manual control in production.
</Callout>

---

## Manual Worker Management

For more control, manage workers manually:

```typescript
// Create adapter without auto-start
const jobs = createBullMQAdapter({
  store: redisStore,
  // No autoStartWorker config
});

// Later, start workers manually
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default', 'email-queue', 'analytics-queue'],
  concurrency: 10,
  onActive: ({ job }) => {
    console.log(`Job ${job.id} started`);
  },
  onSuccess: ({ job, result }) => {
    console.log(`Job ${job.id} completed:`, result);
  },
  onFailure: ({ job, error }) => {
    console.error(`Job ${job.id} failed:`, error);
  },
});
```

---

## Worker Configuration

Configure workers with various options:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  // Queue configuration
  queues: ['default', 'priority-queue'],
  
  // Concurrency control
  concurrency: 10, // Process up to 10 jobs simultaneously
  
  // Job filtering
  jobFilter: ['emails.sendWelcome', 'users.processSignup'], // Only process these jobs
  
  // Event handlers
  onActive: ({ job }) => {
    console.log(`Processing: ${job.name} (${job.id})`);
  },
  
  onSuccess: ({ job, result }) => {
    console.log(`Completed: ${job.name}`, result);
  },
  
  onFailure: ({ job, error }) => {
    console.error(`Failed: ${job.name}`, error);
  },
  
  onIdle: () => {
    console.log('No jobs available');
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `queues` | `string[]` | Queue names to process jobs from |
| `concurrency` | `number` | Maximum concurrent job executions |
| `jobFilter` | `string[]` | Optional: only process specific jobs |
| `onActive` | `function` | Called when a job starts processing |
| `onSuccess` | `function` | Called when a job completes successfully |
| `onFailure` | `function` | Called when a job fails |
| `onIdle` | `function` | Called when queue is empty |

---

## Concurrency Control

Control how many jobs run simultaneously:

```typescript
// Low concurrency - good for CPU-intensive jobs
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['cpu-intensive'],
  concurrency: 2, // Only 2 jobs at a time
});

// High concurrency - good for I/O-bound jobs
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['io-bound'],
  concurrency: 50, // Up to 50 jobs concurrently
});

// Mixed - different queues, different concurrency
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
});

await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['background'],
  concurrency: 5,
});
```

<Callout type="info" title="Choosing Concurrency">
  - **CPU-intensive jobs**: Lower concurrency (2-5) to avoid CPU contention
  - **I/O-bound jobs**: Higher concurrency (10-50) to maximize throughput
  - **Database-heavy jobs**: Moderate concurrency (5-10) to avoid connection pool exhaustion
</Callout>

---

## Queue-Specific Workers

Process different queues with dedicated workers:

```typescript
// Email queue worker
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['email-queue'],
  concurrency: 20, // High concurrency for emails
  onSuccess: ({ job }) => {
    console.log(`Email sent: ${job.name}`);
  },
});

// Analytics queue worker
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['analytics-queue'],
  concurrency: 5, // Lower concurrency for analytics
  onSuccess: ({ job }) => {
    console.log(`Analytics processed: ${job.name}`);
  },
});

// Critical queue worker
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['critical-queue'],
  concurrency: 1, // One at a time for critical jobs
  onFailure: ({ job, error }) => {
    // Alert on critical job failures
    sendAlert(`Critical job failed: ${job.name}`, error);
  },
});
```

---

## Job Filtering

Process only specific jobs from a queue:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
  jobFilter: [
    'emails.sendWelcome',
    'emails.sendPasswordReset',
    // Only process these two jobs, ignore others
  ],
});
```

This is useful when:
- You want separate workers for different job types
- You need to isolate certain jobs for debugging
- You want to process high-priority jobs separately

---

## Event Handlers

React to worker events with handlers:

### onActive

Called when a job starts processing:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  onActive: ({ job }) => {
    console.log(`Job ${job.id} started`);
    trackMetric('job.started', {
      jobId: job.id,
      jobName: job.name,
    });
  },
});
```

### onSuccess

Called when a job completes successfully:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  onSuccess: ({ job, result }) => {
    console.log(`Job ${job.id} completed successfully`);
    trackMetric('job.completed', {
      jobId: job.id,
      executionTime: result.executionTime,
    });
  },
});
```

### onFailure

Called when a job fails:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  onFailure: ({ job, error }) => {
    console.error(`Job ${job.id} failed:`, error);
    
    // Alert on failures
    if (error.critical) {
      sendAlert(`Critical job failed: ${job.name}`, error);
    }
  },
});
```

### onIdle

Called when no jobs are available:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  onIdle: () => {
    console.log('Queue is empty, worker is idle');
    // Could implement health checks or cleanup here
  },
});
```

---

## Multiple Workers

Run multiple workers for redundancy and scale:

```typescript
// Worker 1
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
});

// Worker 2 (same queue, shares load)
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
});

// Worker 3 (dedicated queue)
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['priority-queue'],
  concurrency: 5,
});
```

Multiple workers processing the same queue will automatically share the workload, providing:
- **High availability**: If one worker fails, others continue
- **Scalability**: Add workers to handle increased load
- **Fault tolerance**: Worker failures don't stop job processing

---

## Worker Lifecycle

### Starting Workers

```typescript
// Start a worker
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
});

console.log('Worker started');
```

### Stopping Workers

Gracefully shutdown all workers:

```typescript
// Shutdown all workers and close connections
await jobs.shutdown();

console.log('All workers stopped');
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Graceful Shutdown">
  Always call `shutdown()` before exiting your application to ensure:
  - In-flight jobs complete or are properly handled
  - Redis connections are closed
  - No jobs are lost during shutdown
</Callout>

### Handling Shutdown Signals

In production, handle shutdown signals gracefully:

```typescript
// Handle SIGTERM and SIGINT
process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, shutting down workers...');
  await jobs.shutdown();
  process.exit(0);
});

process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
  console.log('SIGINT received, shutting down workers...');
  await jobs.shutdown();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

## Worker Monitoring

Monitor worker health and performance:

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
  onActive: ({ job }) => {
    // Track active jobs
    activeJobs.increment();
  },
  onSuccess: ({ job, result }) => {
    // Track successful jobs
    successfulJobs.increment();
    activeJobs.decrement();
  },
  onFailure: ({ job, error }) => {
    // Track failed jobs
    failedJobs.increment();
    activeJobs.decrement();
  },
});
```

---

## Advanced Worker Patterns

### Separate Workers for Different Priorities

```typescript
// High priority worker
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['high-priority'],
  concurrency: 1, // One at a time
  onFailure: ({ job, error }) => {
    // Immediate alert for high-priority failures
    sendCriticalAlert(`High-priority job failed: ${job.name}`);
  },
});

// Normal priority worker
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 10,
});
```

### Worker with Retry Logic

```typescript
await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: 5,
  onFailure: async ({ job, error }) => {
    // Custom retry logic
    if (job.attemptsMade < 3) {
      console.log(`Retrying job ${job.id} (attempt ${job.attemptsMade + 1})`);
    } else {
      console.error(`Job ${job.id} failed after all retries`);
      await sendFailureNotification(job, error);
    }
  },
});
```

### Resource-Aware Workers

```typescript
let activeJobCount = 0;
const MAX_CONCURRENT = 10;

await jobs.worker({
  queues: ['default'],
  concurrency: MAX_CONCURRENT,
  onActive: ({ job }) => {
    activeJobCount++;
    console.log(`Active jobs: ${activeJobCount}/${MAX_CONCURRENT}`);
    
    // Pause processing if resource limits reached
    if (activeJobCount >= MAX_CONCURRENT) {
      console.log('Maximum concurrency reached, pausing...');
    }
  },
  onSuccess: ({ job }) => {
    activeJobCount--;
  },
  onFailure: ({ job }) => {
    activeJobCount--;
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set Appropriate Concurrency**: Match concurrency to your workload type
2. **Monitor Worker Health**: Track metrics for active, successful, and failed jobs
3. **Handle Shutdown Gracefully**: Always call `shutdown()` before exiting
4. **Use Separate Workers**: Use different workers for different priorities or queue types
5. **Implement Alerting**: Set up alerts for worker failures or queue buildup
6. **Scale Horizontally**: Run multiple workers for redundancy and scale
7. **Test Worker Behavior**: Verify workers handle job failures correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Workers Not Processing Jobs

**Problem**: Jobs are queued but not executing

**Solutions**:
- Verify workers are started: Check logs for "Starting worker for queue"
- Check queue names: Ensure workers process the correct queues
- Verify Redis connection: Workers need access to Redis
- Check job filters: Verify `jobFilter` isn't excluding your jobs

### High Memory Usage

**Problem**: Workers consuming too much memory

**Solutions**:
- Reduce concurrency: Lower `concurrency` value
- Process smaller batches: Limit number of jobs processed simultaneously
- Monitor job memory usage: Some jobs may be memory-intensive

### Worker Crashes

**Problem**: Workers crash unexpectedly

**Solutions**:
- Add error handling: Wrap job handlers in try-catch
- Monitor logs: Check for unhandled errors
- Implement health checks: Verify worker availability
- Use process managers: Use PM2 or similar to restart crashed workers
