By the end of this guide, you'll have Lia configured and ready to work in your preferred development environment.

## Configuring Lia with the CLI

The easiest way to set up Lia is through the Igniter.js CLI. Even after initial project creation, you can configure or update Lia at any time.

<Card title="Step-by-step">
  <Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Run the Lia configuration command

    ```bash
    npx @igniter-js/cli@latest lia
    ```

    This launches an interactive menu for managing Lia configurations.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Choose your action

    The main menu offers several options:

    - **Initialize LIA on my Code Agents**: Set up Lia for your preferred development tools
    - **Sync All Configurations**: Update all AI code agent settings across your environment
    - **Update .gitignore**: Add Lia-specific patterns to your .gitignore file
    - **Exit**: Close the menu
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Configure code agents (if selected)

    When initializing Lia, you'll see a multi-select list of supported code agents:

    - GitHub Copilot
    - Cursor
    - Claude Code
    - Codex CLI
    - Gemini CLI
    - OpenCode
    - Cline
    - Roo Code
    - Qwen Code
    - Kiro IDE
    - Amazon Q Developer CLI
    - JetBrains Junie
    - AugmentCode
    - Windsurf
    - Warp

    Select all the agents you use, then confirm to apply the configuration. This replaces their default training with Lia's specialized setup for the Igniter.js ecosystem.
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Verify the setup

    After configuration, Lia will be ready to work in your chosen agents. Test her by asking for help with a simple task, like creating a new page or controller.
