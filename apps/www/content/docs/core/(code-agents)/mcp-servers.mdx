description: Comprehensive guide to configuring and using the Igniter.js Model Context Protocol server for code generation, browser testing, and more.
---

By the end of this guide, you'll have a complete understanding of what a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is, how to configure the Igniter.js MCP server in your favorite IDE or Code Agent, and what tools it provides to enhance your development workflow.

## What is an MCP Server?

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** is a specialized backend that acts as a bridge between an AI model (like a code agent) and your development environment. It follows a standard protocol that allows the AI to securely access context-aware tools and information that are not part of its general training data.

Think of it as giving your AI assistant a set of superpowers tailored specifically to your project. Instead of just understanding code, it can now:

- Interact with your local development server.
- Run tests and builds.
- Scaffold new features based on your project's conventions.
- Analyze your codebase with deep, contextual understanding.
- Safely access your database or other services.

This allows AI agents like Lia to perform complex, multi-step tasks autonomously, moving beyond simple code completion to become a true pair programmer.

## How to Add the Igniter.js MCP Server

Integrating the Igniter.js MCP Server into your development tool is straightforward. It is typically defined in a JSON configuration file that your IDE or code agent reads on startup.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Server Won't Start">
- Check that all required packages are installed (`npx` should handle this, but network issues can occur).
- Verify environment variables are set correctly if needed by any tool.
- Ensure no other process is using the same port if the server requires one.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tool Execution Fails">
- Validate input parameters match tool specifications.
- Check for permission issues (file system, network).
- Review error logs for detailed failure information.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Performance Issues">
- Adjust timeout values for slow operations.
- Optimize queries and reduce data transfer for tools that interact with external services.
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data.
