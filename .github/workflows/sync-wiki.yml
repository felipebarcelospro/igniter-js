# .github/workflows/sync-wiki.yml

# Name for the GitHub Action workflow.
# This is what will be displayed in the "Actions" tab of the repository.
name: Sync Documentation to Wiki

# This section defines the triggers that will run this workflow.
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on a 'push' event.
  push:
    # Only run for pushes to the 'main' branch.
    branches:
      - main
    # Further refine the trigger to only run if files within the
    # 'docs/wiki-content/' directory have been changed. This prevents
    # the action from running on every single push to main, saving resources.
    paths:
      - 'docs/wiki-content/**'

# Define the permissions required by this workflow.
# The GITHUB_TOKEN provided by GitHub Actions needs 'write' permissions
# on the repository's contents to be able to push changes to the wiki.
permissions:
  contents: write

# This section defines the jobs that will be run as part of the workflow.
jobs:
  # Define a single job named 'sync-wiki-job'.
  sync-wiki-job:
    # Specify the runner environment. 'ubuntu-latest' is a standard and reliable choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The sequence of steps that make up the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the main repository's code.
      # This step downloads the source code of the 'main' branch,
      # making the 'docs/wiki-content/' directory available to the job.
      - name: Checkout main repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # persist-credentials: false is a good practice when the token is only used for a single checkout
          persist-credentials: false

      # Step 2: Check out the repository's wiki.
      # The wiki is a separate git repository. We check it out into a subdirectory
      # named 'wiki' to keep it separate from the main repository's code.
      - name: Checkout wiki repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # The wiki repository URL is the main repository URL with '.wiki' appended.
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}.wiki
          # The destination path for the checkout.
          path: wiki
          # persist-credentials: false is a good practice when the token is only used for a single checkout
          persist-credentials: false

      # Step 3: Synchronize the documentation files to the wiki directory.
      # This step uses 'rsync' to mirror the contents. It's a powerful tool
      # that efficiently copies new and updated files.
      - name: Sync documentation files to wiki
        run: |
          # The -av flags mean "archive" (preserves permissions, etc.) and "verbose".
          # The --delete flag is crucial: it removes any files from the 'wiki' directory
          # that no longer exist in the 'docs/wiki-content' directory, keeping them perfectly in sync.
          # The --exclude flag prevents copying the .git directory itself.
          rsync -av --delete --exclude='.git/' docs/wiki-content/ ./wiki/

      # Step 4: Commit and push any changes to the wiki repository.
      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          # Navigate into the wiki's local directory.
          cd wiki

          # Configure the git user identity for the commit.
          # This attributes the commit to the github-actions bot.
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"

          # Stage all changes (new, modified, and deleted files).
          git add .

          # Check if there are any staged changes. If there are no changes,
          # the 'git diff-index --quiet HEAD' command will exit with code 0.
          # This prevents creating empty commits if no documentation was changed.
          if ! git diff-index --quiet HEAD; then
            echo "Changes detected in wiki. Committing and pushing."
            git commit -m "docs: Sync wiki from main repository"
